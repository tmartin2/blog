There are a several questions on Metaculus that pertain to volcanos, and this makes sense - volcanos are extraordinary marvels of geology and are reminders there is activity _down there_, down beneath the crust. More crucially, though, strong volcanic activity can wreak havoc on human activities, so it makes sense to predict when they will occur. In this post, I forecast on one volcano question that I posed, and also predict on other volcano questions.

## Active Volcanos in 2022

## Volcanic Eruptions in 2022

## VEI Level 6 or Higher Eruption Before 2025
