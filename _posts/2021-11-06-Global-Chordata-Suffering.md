Since August, I have started volunteering some of my time (the commitment is 10 hours per week) to assist [InvincibleWellbeing](https://www.invinciblewellbeing.com/home) (IW) in their quest to "_target the genetic capacity of suffering_". While IW does not currently have the technological and cognitive resources to realize this goal themselves, IW wants to use the Joshua Cefalu Prize to incentivize researchers to conduct literature reviews on the following questions:

- What are the root biological substrates of suffering?
- What neurological circuit likely underpins suffering across sentient life?
- What is the most sensible way to quantify the distribution of suffering among species?
- What is the most appropriate model organism to carefully study the effects of gene drives and other suffering-focused therapies?
- Given the answers to the previous questions, what is likely to be the best long-term strategy (scientific, political, business, etc) for safely and effectively phasing out the root biological cause of suffering? Stake a bold claim despite the uncertainty.

So, where do I factor into this? A small fraction of my time with them has been spent drafting and sending emails to various researchers in the field of quantitative biology. More of time my has been spent reading sections of works such as _Maldynia: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on the Illness of Chronic Pain_ and trying to understand what categories the neural correlates of suffering can be decomposed into. I composed a short problem statement to advocate for writing a sequence of EA-forum posts that (1) detail why targeting suffering neurologically should be less neglect as a method for reducing suffering globally, (2) what societal obstacles there are that disincentivize this type of work, and what might be able to be done to change this, and (3) a review of existing theories of suffering. While other members and I agreed this action trajectory would likely be effective, there was work to be done elsewhere, namely with the _population ecology_ project, which is a sort of minimally viable product for characterizing an upper bound on the amount of suffering that occurred globally within the phylum Chordata. Given my background with neuroscience, mathematics, and programming in Python, I am the member who appears most able to make a contribution in this regard. Thus, ___I am currently working on finding all Chordata family names, populations, neuron counts, and median lifespan___.

This is a large task, but some work has already been done on it, and my hope is that this work can allow me to better triangulate the values detailed above. I am standing on the shoulders of

- Georgia Ray's _How many neurons are there?_ post on her blog [Eukaryote Writes](https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/how-many-neurons-are-there/)
- Bar-on, Phillips, and Milo's 2018 paper [The biomass distribution of Earth](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506)
- [The Catalogue of Life](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/): "_The COL Checklist aims to provide researchers, policy-makers, environmental managers, and the wider public with a consistent and up-to-date index of the names of all the worldâ€™s known species_"

The rest of this post is me working through my estimates in public so people can criticize them or provide advice. Please use the email I have listed on this site to contact me.
