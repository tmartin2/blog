This is a question I was given on a test task after applying to
a fellowship on AI policy. I spent roughly an hour writing my response.
The question goes

_What is the likelihood that at least one single new pandemic (not SARS-CoV-2 or variants) causes >=0.04% of world population to die within a one year period (as measured by the official reported death toll, not excess deaths) by 2032 Jan 1? Why do you give that answer? What factors are important?_

Here is my answer. As with my [AI regulation post](https://tmartin2.github.io/my-blog/), I describe criticisms of my responses, and detail some considerations that I missed in my response.
