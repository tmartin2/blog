I went on a Substack subscription binge in October 2021, and came across
Alexander Kruel's [Axis of Ordinary](https://axisofordinary.substack.com/). His two most popular posts are _[The most counterintuitive facts in all of mathematics, computer science, and physics](https://axisofordinary.substack.com/p/the-most-counterintuitive-facts-in)_ and _[I have questions](https://axisofordinary.substack.com/p/i-have-questions)_. This latter post resulted in me subscribing. For this post on Alexander's questions, I reply "I have answers!", and below they rest, silently on my Internet space. Of course, if I spent much more time on these answers, they could alter quite tremendously, but might instead simply remain the same. I don't know, so I forewarn: I am a Bayesian, my beliefs are update-able; if I am "incorrect", update me!

__Question 1__

> Suppose there was a gene L for laziness and a gene M for mental retardation. People with gene L cannot earn a living because they are too lazy. People with gene M cannot earn a living because they are not intelligent enough. Are people with one of those genes more deserving of social welfare than people with the other gene?

TM: Immediate reaction: no, "while laziness seems to be a personal fault, and mental retardation an intractable facet of life, there's an argument to made that serious laziness is just as intractable (genetic) as mental retardation".

After some thought: This answer depends on what's being optimized for, and on the nature of the social welfare. These come to mind as things that might be optimized for in this scenario: collective (societal) well-being, individual well-being, fairness, societal growth/operation. These come to mind as ideas for the nature of social welfare here: binary (i.e., receive welfare or don't receive it) or numerical (this amount of USD vs. this other amount). The key word here appears to be the word "deserving", so this sets the optimization metric to "fairness". Operating from the viewpoint of receiving or not receiving social welfare, I think it is societally fair that people with gene L and people with gene M both receive some sort of welfare, as they both cannot earn a living in the current system. Under the definition of social welfare as some quantity of USD received, I think that it is fair that the people with gene L receive a fraction of the social welfare that people with gene M receive, proportional to the intractability of their laziness. This means that if someone with gene L is intractably lazy, then they are just as deserving of social welfare as someone with mental retardation. However, should someone with gene L have some potential, then they are slightly less deserving of social welfare. Perhaps there could be some baseline that everyone gets, and the extra amount that this person with gene L receives over the baseline is proportional to the amount that people with mental retardation receive, with the maximum being exactly what the people with gene M receive. This all assumes that there are degrees of tractability for laziness and none for mental retardation.
