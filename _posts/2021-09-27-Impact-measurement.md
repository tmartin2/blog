I would like to more thoroughly investigate the impact I have on the world. This includes determining roughly how my interactions with other people affect their well-being; how much energy is required to sustain my habits (this would be the energy expenditure involved in the transportation, distribution, production, etc... of the goods and services I consume or utilize); and what my carbon/emissions footprint is.

Before I act on this, I would like to further reduce the likelihood that I waste my time doing something intractable or unuseful. So, as a first step, I ask:

___What metrics might be useful for measuring an individual's short-term and long-term impact on civilization and the biosphere?___

I have already thought about estimating my impact in terms of emissions, energy expenditures, and well-being fluctuations in others, but would like to know if this list should be expanded or pruned.  

While there are more questions I could ask (e.g., how should I proceed in measuring metric x), I think the question I have asked above is a decent first step in this project.

In addition to any answers to this question, a pointer to resources or existing literature on the topic of "human impact quantification" (or an equivalent term) would be highly appreciated.  I do not know if similar projects have been carried out, save for posts similar to Scott Alexander's [Carbon Cost Quantified](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/carbon-costs-quantified). An interesting prototype question I have thought of for my investigation is: _How costly (in terms of energy expenditure or emissions) is it for me to use a single square of toilet paper?._

A tangential question to this one that focuses more on the successful execution of a project on impact quantification might be: _What are some products or services that more easily allow one to quantify the impact they make by using them?_ Any advice (questions or other considerations) of this nature would also be useful to me.
