I am one of many Trevor Martin's, but this may change, as I am considering changing my name to something more distinguishable. At this present moment in life, I am nearly finished with my undergraduate studies of Neuroscience and Mathematics, but still have a long way to go in terms of functionally understanding the core content of these domains. Most of my recent (last 2-3 years) interest has concerned _machine learning_, and I am now close to publishing a paper on one application of it - ensemble learning for splice site prediction. This is not generally the line of work I would like to be doing though, and I am more interested in global priorities research and forecasting. Ideally, I would like to spend most of my time nestled at the edge of the wilderness, and engage myself in a variety of pursuits: conducting biotechnological projects (e.g., automated aqua- and hydroponics), writing literature reviews (e.g., on human coordination, measurement of well-being, different global priorities, etc...), making collages and other mathematical art, reproducing ML papers or improving ML algorithm robustness, and improving the accuracy of my forecasts. I am looking for a remote occupation within the sphere of effective altruism, and hope that it has significant overlap with the above things.
